             Before loading the operating system, you may choose
             language, keymap, timezone and resolution, by using
             F2-F5 keys.

             The live system does not require space on your harddisk.

             If you can't start Manjaro Linux, don't worry!
             We are ready to help you! 
                     
             Thank you for choosing Manjaro Linux!
