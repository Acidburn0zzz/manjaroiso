1. Synapse
----------

Synapse is a semantic file launcher, used in place of traditional menus to find and launch installed applications. While running in the background, a grey and blue icon will be present in the top panel. In this instance, Synapse can be started by pressing the <ctrl> + <spacebar> keys. Otherwise, it is also  possible to start it by pressing the <Super / Windows> + <s> keys.

Synapse is also capable of much more than just launching applications, particularly given the number of optional plug-ins available. It can also be used to:

* Find and access particular file types such as documents, images, or movies
* Open folders
* Directly control applications such as Banshee and XNoise
* Execute terminal commands
* Submit Google searches

It is also worthwhile noting that Synapse can remember previous searches, meaning the desired result can be acheived with as little as a single keystroke. To see the range of options available, click the top-right dot on the Synapse panel, then "preferences", and then the "plugins" tab. In the "General" tab it is also possible to select different themes. 

Navigation is undertaken using the <arrow> keys, rather than the mouse (e.g. use the <left or right arrow keys> to select particular search categories). In respect the default theme, while a search is being undertaken, it is also possible to press the <down arrow> key to show more results. In addition, further options for a highlighted result can also be presented by pressing the <tab> key. Again, Synapse is a very powerful and versatile tool, so it is worth the time to explore and become familar with it.


2. Keyboard Shortcuts
---------------------

Openbox is particularly notable for its standard inclusion of keyboard shortcuts to quickly do things. These have been retained, with a few extra custom keybindings:

<Super / Windows> + <a> : Launch Application Finder
<Super / Windows> + <f> : Launch default File Manager (Thunar)
<Super / Windows> + <s> : Launch Synapse (if not already running in the background)
<Super / Windows> + <t> : Launch Terminal
<Super / Windows> + <x> : Logout and Shutdown Options

Where presented with the Logout and Shutdown options, one of the following keys can then be pressed:

<esc> : Cancel
<l> : Logout
<r> : Restart / Reboot
<s> : Shutdown
<k> : Lock


3. Scrolling and Workspace Switching
------------------------------------

If the mouse pointer is placed over an open application window, then the wheel may be used to scroll through up or down its contents. Otherwise, if the mouse pointer is place over the desktop or the panel, then the wheel may be used to quickly switch to other workspaces. It is of course also possible to select a desired workspace by simply clicking
the desired one in the workspace switcher, located in the top-right of the screen. The standard shortcut keys are also available (i.e. <ctrl> + <alt> + <left or right arrow key>).


4. Multimedia Support
---------------------

In order to keep the size of this installation file to a minimum, full Multimedia support has not been pre-installed. To enable multimedia support, the following command should be entered in the Terminal, or in Synapse:

sudo pacman -Sy gstreamer0.10-plugins

Furthermore, although ALSA is used as standard for sound, Pluse Audio can be installed with the following command:

sudo pacman -Sy manjaro-pulse


5. Printing Support
-------------------

Again, to keep the ISO file size down, printing capabilties has not been automatically pre-installed. To enable this feature, enter the following command in the terminal or in Synapse:

sudo pacman -Sy manjaro-printer && sudo systemctl enable cups.service

Once complete, reboot the system for the change to take effect, or enter the following command to start printing immediately:

sudo systemctl start cups.service


6. Accessing the Arch User Repository (AUR)
-------------------------------------------

The Arch User Repository contains a substantial amount of additional software not otherwise available. However, none of the packages are officially supported by the Manjaro Team, so use it at your own risk. To enable access to the AUR, enter the following command in the terminal or in Synapse:

sudo pacman -S base-devel yaourt

Once installed, the AUR can be immediately accessed by using the yaourt command in the terminal (not Synapse), along with the full or partial name of the software package desired:

yaourt [full or partial name of software package]

More details are available in our wiki: http://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository


7. Recommended Applications
---------------------------

You guessed it - only a basic suite of applications have been pre-installed to minimise the download size of the ISO file. While this also provides an opportunity for users to build a software library they want without having to remove too much first, beginners may find the following suggestions helpful:

Internet: Chromium (don't forget to add the extensions addblockplus and ghostery)
Movies: VLC
Music: Banshee or RhythmBox
Full Office: LibreOffice (an easy-to-use installer for this has been pre-installed)
Light Office: AbiWord, Gnumeric and Yelp (yelp is used to provide help)
Image Manipulation: Gimp

If you want to add an extra dock or taskbar to the desktop (or even replace tint2 alogether), the Avant Window Navigator is a good choice. Just don't forget there extras package for it, too. Both are available from the official Manjaro repositories.
